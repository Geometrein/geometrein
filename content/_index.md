## About Me

---

I am a Data Scientist with a curious mindset and a strong passion for finding and understanding patterns.  
My interests include Mathematics, Computer Science, Architecture, and Urbanism.

I enjoy helping startups turn messy data into clear insights, scalable systems, and product-ready models.
If you’re working on something ambitious and need a data partner, feel free to reach out—I'm always open to new and challenging collaborations.

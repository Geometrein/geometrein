## Education

### **Aalto University**  
**Master of Science (MSc)**  
_2015 – 2019_

>The research conducted as part of this master's thesis aimed to enhance urban big data analytics by integrating graph-theoretical approaches with computational geometry.
The study utilized graph-based methods to identify and analyze complex topological structures, symmetries, isomorphisms, and connectivity within spatial networks.
The proposed framework provided a rigorous approach to effectively model, represent, and analyze intricate urban environments through computationally efficient graph-theoretical metrics.

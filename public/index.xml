&lt;p>What are Helsinki City bikes?
Helsinki City Bikes are shared bicycles available to the public in Helsinki and Espoo metropolitan areas.
The main aim of the Helsinki city bike system is to address the so-called last-mile problem present in all distribution networks.
The city bikes were introduced in 2016 as a pilot project with only 46 bike stations available in Helsinki.
After becoming popular among the citizens, Helsinki city decided to gradually expand the bike network.
In the period between 2017 and 2019, approximately one hundred stations were being added to the network each year.
By 2019 the bike network reached its complete state with only 7 stations being added in 2020.
As of 2020, there were 3,510 bikes and 350 stations operating in Helsinki and Espoo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>http://localhost:1313/docs/about_me/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 07:07:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/about_me/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-me">

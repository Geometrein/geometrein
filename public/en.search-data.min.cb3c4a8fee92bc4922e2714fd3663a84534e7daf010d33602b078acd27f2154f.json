Helsinki City Bikes are shared bicycles available to the public in Helsinki and Espoo metropolitan areas. The main aim of the Helsinki city bike system is to address the so-called last-mile problem present in all distribution networks. The city bikes were introduced in 2016 as a pilot project with only 46 bike stations available in Helsinki. After becoming popular among the citizens, Helsinki city decided to gradually expand the bike network. In the period between 2017 and 2019, approximately one hundred stations were being added to the network each year. By 2019 the bike network reached its complete state with only 7 stations being added in 2020. As of 2020, there were 3,510 bikes and 350 stations operating in Helsinki and Espoo.\nSince 2016 more than 10.000.000 rides have been made. The total distance of the trips is 25.291.523 kilometres. To put that in perspective 25.3 million kilometres is 65 times the distance to the moon. The total time all residents spent riding the bikes is approximately 280 Years and 4 months.\nIn order to use the city bikes, citizens purchase access for a day, week or the entire cycling season that lasts from April to November. All passes include an unlimited number of 30-minute bike rides. For an extra fee of 1€/hour, you can use the bike for longer. Bikes are picked up and returned to stations that are located all around Helsinki and Espoo.\nWhat the average ride looks like? # The city bike system has grown significantly since 2016, however, how the city bikes are used has not changed substantially. If we look at the individual trips made drug the last 5 years, we will see that the average ride duration is around 13 minutes while the average travelled distance is approximately 2242 meters(1.4 miles). Given the right-skewed distribution of the data, the averages are slightly skewed and the majority of trips actually last from 4–8 minutes and cover a distance of 1700 meters (approx.1 mile).\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/about_me/","title":"About Me","section":"Docs","content":" About Me # "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/cv/","title":"Curriculum Vitae","section":"Docs","content":" Curriculum Vitae # "}]
